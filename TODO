ADJUST PATHS IN JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS AND IN CUSTOM CODE



THINK OF WORKFLOW
WHICH INCLUDES / NAMES RELEVANT JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS

MAKE IT RUN IN SHELL?

workflow:

-download wordnet
-save living-things subset
-compute transitive closure of living things
DONE
- FIX ENVIRONMENT

-train on various dimensions
-save weights!
-plot both in one run
    -use those weights for plotting the whole tree
    -use those weights to plot subtree with relevant parents

one button click to do EVERYTHING!

do this in shell, then in jupyter notebook  

ADVANCED WORKFLOW


-download wordnet
-save living-things subset
-INCLUSION OF NODE DELETION 
-compute transitive closure of living things
-train on various dimensions
-save weights!
-FOR PLOTTING INCLUSION OF TARGET-PLOT LIST
-plot both in one run
    -use those weights for plotting the whole tree

    -use those weights to plot subtree with relevant parents
