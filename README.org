* Multi-parent Relations of Poincare Embeddings for Learning Hierarchical Representations

Forked project of the PyTorch implementation of [[https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7213-poincare-embeddings-for-learning-hierarchical-representations][Poincar√© Embeddings for Learning Hierarchical Representations]]

** Installation
Simply clone this repository via
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git clone https://github.com/ikiraschielke/poincare-multi-parent-embeddings
  cd poincare-multi-parent-embeddings
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  source activate poincare-parents
  python setup.py build_ext --inplace
#+END_SRC


** Example: Embedding WordNet Living Things

For a quick start, the transitive closure of the WordNet living things subtree is already given.
To embed the living subtree in the reconstruction setting (i.e., without missing data), go to the root directory of the project and run
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    ./main.sh
#+END_SRC

This shell script includes parameter settings for various dimensionality settings for the living subtree and saves the trained model as =wordnet_living_closure_dim"$DIM"_"$EPOCHS".pth=
